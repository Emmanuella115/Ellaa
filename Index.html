  <p>
    A member of the Labour Party since 2022, Obi was the presidential candidate in the 
    2023 Nigerian presidential election. Born in Onitsha, Anambra State, he attended 
    Christ the King College for his secondary education and the University of Nigeria, 
    Nsukka for his tertiary education.
  </p>
  <p>
    He began his career in banking and later went into politics when he contested 
    for Anambra State Governor in 2003 under the All Progressives Grand Alliance. 
    Although Chris Ngige was initially declared the winner, the result was annulled 
    following a legal ruling. Obi was later declared the rightful winner and took office 
    on 17 March 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
    His administration was interrupted on 3 November 2006 when the state assembly 
    removed him from office for alleged “gross misconduct.” The position devolved to 
    his deputy, Dame Virginia Etiaba. Obi challenged the impeachment in court and 
    was reinstated on 9 February 2007. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Later in May 2007, despite Obi’s ongoing tenure, elections were held and Andy Uba 
    of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) was declared governor. Obi again went to 
    court, and the Supreme Court upheld his position, overturning Uba’s swearing-in. 
    This allowed Obi to complete his term from 14 June 2007 to 17 March 2010. 
    He was successfully re-elected and governed until 17 March 2014, when he handed 
    over to his successor, Willie Obiano.
